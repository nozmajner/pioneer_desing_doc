# Modeling

- General suggested folder and collection structure
  - Shipname/subdirs and files
  - Top level collections

## Target tri count

- For the top LoD
- Depends on scale
- Provide examples

## Model quality

- Quads wherever possible, but don't aim for all-quads model
- Ngons are fine, but should be triangulated before export
- Quad/tri proportions
- Using subsurf
- Bevel
- What to put on separate meshes
- Mirror modifier
- Using booleans
- **Scale should be 1,1,1!**

## Standard parts

- Asset library setup (via git, either [forking](https://gist.github.com/acidtone/aeea8025550587db9e557e3b9a5bd982) or just downloading)
- Docking collars - from asset library!
- Engines - from asset library
- Typical RCS shape language and sizes
- Landing gears - there are some available in the asset library
- Sensors, antennas, etc
