# Animation

- Preferably with armatures for complex gear operation (easier to bake - double check that)
  - Constraints like tracks, IK
- Using an armature, or an armatured prefab
- How to mirror them?
- Refer to animation baking (because this is for the creation of nice animations, before commiting to anything)
